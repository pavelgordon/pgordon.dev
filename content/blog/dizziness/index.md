Here is a story about how I fight this. I hope that someday I will be able to write that I won it. 

It all started on July 9, 2020. 
I was sitting in the chair, and got up. Suddenly I realised that I have a terrible headspin. I tried to wash my hands, but it was getting worse and worse with every second. I tried to lay down on the bed, but it didn't help at all. 

This feeling is awful. Everything moves around, and you become scared, because the same ground is not reliable anymore. You try to grap and hold onto something, but everything is moving, spinning around, and you can't help it at all, and every your movement makes thnigs worse.

In fear, I waited around 10-15 minutes to see if it will go away by itself. Of course it didn't, so I called an ambulance. But I was not immediately dying, so they gave me some sedative and let me go home. I don't remember how I was able to arrive home, I lost all memory of that day - my friend told me that I called him and described my situation twice :)

Since then, my journey started. My German was bad, and it was hard for me to think property, but I visited nearest GP and was barely able to explain my situation - but all I got was an injection to my neck and that was it.

While being in Germany, I also visited physiotherapy and cardiologyst, still with the same results - everything is okay/looks normal. I mean, not completely healhy of course, but nothing that  Only when I moved to Netherlands, I was able to find clarity and possible solutions.

I will finish this article on my way to Sweden already.
