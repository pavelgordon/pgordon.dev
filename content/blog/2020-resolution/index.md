2020 was not an easy year for the world. Below is summary of the most important outcomes in my 2020, and ideas of what will be in 2021.

## What happened with Pavel in 2020?

#### I changed everything around me yet again
This year, after two years of hard work, I said goodbye to my wonderful team at FreeNOW in Hamburg. I got a chance to live for a shot time in beautiful Amsterdam, where I worked at MessageBird with ones of the most passionate people I have ever met. I finished my year in Stockholm, where as member of the engineering team I will contribute to Spotify - and do it with [my best friend](https://lyamkin.com/).

#### I started my contribution to open-source
I work as a software engineer for more than 4 years. Still, I have never contributed to open-source. It's hard to admit, but I was afraid of breaking things and getting criticism. This year, I contributed to [hibernate-types](https://github.com/vladmihalcea/hibernate-types) of Vlad Mihalcea. Also, as a person who learns new languages on a daily basis, I understand how difficult it can be, so I published a couple of tweaks for [Anki/Babbel](https://github.com/pavelgordon/babbel2anki-chrome-extension) and [Duolingo/Anki](https://github.com/pavelgordon/duolingo2anki-chrome-extension) integrations, which (hopefully) will make this process a little bit easier.

#### I unlocked quarter of the century award -  passed my 25 years threshold. 
It could mean many things - e.g. that I am a adult, or that I can start using the phrase "back in my days".   
Unfortunately, it also comes with disadvantages. Since the June of 2020, I am fighting vertigo. It's been a rough half of the year for me, and I still haven't managed to eliminate it - mostly this is due to the relocation to different countries and being desperate from time to time(=giving up). But I managed to embrace the fact that there is no pill for everything, and sometimes healing takes a lot of time and effort.

## My objectives for 2021
#### Focus on health
2020 was filled with coronavirus. But even if you are lucky enough to not get sick, there are other problems that world experiences right now. Anxiety, constant stress, lack of physical activity, etc. It affected a lot of people, including me. I want to live as long as possible, and thefore next year I have to improve my life in this direction.
#### Develop self-awareness
It might sound contradictory - after all in 2020 most of us have to sit in our flats and we should have all time in the world for ourselves, right? Well, not for me - I just got more time to spend, and I spent it "suboptimal". This is because without self-control, it's easy to get lost in the routine of life, forget your habits and accept someone else' values - that's what has happened to me.
During the next year, I want to figure out myself and understand my needs and desires. 

#### Share
Sharing information is important, as it gives more knowledge to both speaker and listener. I struggle with putting my thoughts on the paper, with completion of the things and with anxiety it causes, and this is my focus point for the 2021 - sharing, regardless of the fear.

#### Innovation
I’m proud to be a part of the group launching [Sourcexperts](https://sourcexperts.com/). It’s a distributed product development and venture investing studio.
